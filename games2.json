{"games":[{"game":"CO2","id":"72225","year":"2012","name":"CO2","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72225","desc":"In the 1970s, the governments of the world faced unprecedented demand for energy, and polluting power plants were built everywhere in order to meet that demand. Year after year, the pollution they generate increases, and nobody has done anything to reduce it. Now, the impact of this pollution has become too great, and humanity is starting to realize that we must meet our energy demands through clean sources of energy. Companies with expertise in clean, sustainable energy are called in to propose projects that will provide the required energy without polluting the environment. Regional governments are eager to fund these projects, and to invest in their implementation.\r\n\r\nIf the pollution isn't stopped, it's game over for all of us.\r\n\r\nIn the game CO2, each player is the CEO of an energy company responding to government requests for new, green power plants. The goal is to stop the increase of pollution, while meeting the rising demand for sustainable energy - and of course profiting from doing so. You will need enough expertise, money, and resources to build these clean power plants. Energy summits will promote global awareness, and allow companies to share a little of their expertise, while learning still more from others.\r\n\r\nIn CO2, each region starts with a certain number of Carbon Emissions Permits (CEPs) at its disposal. These CEPs are granted by the United Nations, and they must be spent whenever the region needs to install the energy infrastructure for a project, or to construct a fossil fuel power plant. CEPs can be bought and sold on a market, and their price fluctuates throughout the game. You will want to try to maintain control over the CEPs.\r\n\r\nMoney, CEPs, Green Power Plants that you've built, UN Goals you've completed, Company Goals you've met, and Expertise you've gained all give you Victory Points (VPs), which represent your Company's reputation - and having the best reputation is the goal of the game ... in addition to saving the planet, of course.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic1350204.jpg","categoriesprint":"Economic, Environmental, and Industry / Manufacturing","mechanicsprint":"Area Control / Area Influence, Card Drafting, and Worker Placement","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmax":"120","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/environmental.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/industrymanufacturing.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/areacontrolareainfluence.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/workerplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Rise of Tribes","id":"202583","year":"2018","name":"Rise of Tribes","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202583","desc":"In ancient prehistoric times, you have discovered a new land with plentiful lakes, mountains and forests (and apparently many stone rocks that shall be called dice). Your people can develop new things like basketry or find oxen or simply GROW and conquer.\r\n\r\nIn Rise of Tribes, players control a tribal faction in prehistoric times looking to GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and LEAD their people. The board is modular, composed of hexes in various terrain types. Each hex has a population limit. Players manage the number of tribe members they place on any one hex to either trigger or avoid conflict.\r\n\r\nEach turn the active player rolls two dice, then selects two of the four actions to take -  GROW, MOVE, GATHER, and/or LEAD. Each action is reslved one action at a time. The power of each action taken depends on the die roll plus the last couple of dice placed onto the action board on the selected action by other players. Once both actions are taken, the active player resolves any Conflicts. The final step of each turn is the time to build villages and complete goal cards.\r\n\r\nVictory is possible in a couple ways: gathering resources to build villages and/or completing development and achievement goal cards for your civilization. Villages (limited to 1 per hex) score 1 point for the tribe that built them at the start of that tribe's turn. Goal cards will score points immediately when completed. Every tribe's ambition is to score 15 points.

The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Take one resource of your choice and two camels.

Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.\r\n\r\nAuf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic2461346.png","categoriesprint":"Dice, Economic, Medieval, and Travel","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Point to Point Movement, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, and Worker Placement","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"40","tto":"to","tmax":"100","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/dice.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/medieval.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/dicerolling.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/pointtopointmovement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/workerplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Keyflower","id":"122515","year":"2012","name":"Keyflower","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122515","desc":"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a \"home\" tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.\r\n\r\nIn spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.\r\n\r\nKeyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game.

Fifty years ago, business was blooming when the codfish would come for spawning. Today, Nusfjord is more of a museum than a village, with less than a hundred people living there. Imagine how beautiful this place must be given that you must pay a fee to even look at the houses. Cruise ships used to pass by this long and now mostly abandoned island world.\r\n\r\nIn the time period in which the game Nusfjord is set, things looked quite different. Sailing ships dominate the fjord. The rocks around Nusfjord are covered in trees. As the owner of a major fishing company in Nusfjord on the Lofoten archipelago, your goal is to develop the harbor and the surrounding landscape, and to succeed you must enlarge your fleet, clear the forest, erect new buildings, and satisfy the local elders. Others do this as well, of course, so the competition is steep.\r\n\r\nAs with Agricola and Ora et Labora, Nusfjord has a worker placement mechanism, with each player starting with three workers that they place on a central board to trigger certain actions. Whether a player wants to clear a forest on their own board, buy a new cutter, or construct a building, they must place a worker on the appropriate space - which is possible only if room is available for this worker. Money is scarce, and one of the quicker and easier ways to get it is to place shares of your own company on the market. This risky action could be worthwhile because if you succeed in buying these shares yourself, you have usually won money and not suffered any disadvantages; however, if an opponent acquires these shares, then you must allow them to benefit from your hard-earned catches at sea. The village elders might want their own share of your catch as well, especially if you've visited them to take certain actions in the village, so if you don't take care, your catch could end up entirely in the hands of others and your camp will be empty.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3729114.png","categoriesprint":"Economic","mechanicsprint":"Worker Placement","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmin":"20","tto":"to","tmax":"100","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/workerplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Lowlands","id":"242804","year":"2018","name":"Lowlands","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/242804","desc":"The low land is a rough area where hard-working folk make a living by the sweat of their brow. Under constant threat of storm and flood, communities here rally together to build dikes that keep the rising water at bay. But every citizen constructing a dike is one fewer citizen tending flocks and maintaining the family farm. The residents here are constantly torn between selflessness and self-interest, and only those who can strike this delicate balance can thrive in this harsh landscape.\r\n\r\nIn Lowlands, you carve your farm out of this unforgiving land, gathering and spending resource cards to transform your farmyard into pastures that allow you to profit from breeding sheep. Adding expansions to your farm will unlock new options and score you victory points, but helping to build the dike that collectively protects all players is also rewarded. No matter what, the tide will rise and, if the dike isn't high enough, it could rush in and sweep away your hard-earned profits. Will you sacrifice your own farm for the good of the community, or will you pursue your own agenda? The choice is yours.\r\n\r\nEven without the poor weather, life on a farm is one of constant work where you find yourself tending flocks of sheep, extending their pastures, and looking for the right moment to sell them for a profit. To complete all these tasks, Lowlands gives you a group of farmers that you can assign to various tasks around your farm. To get the most out of them, you must think strategically, deciding which actions you want to take and the best time to take them. Once they've been assigned, your farmers help you build a bustling farm where there was once scrubby bushes, trees, and lakes. You begin the game with only two sheep and a small pasture, but your farmyard is rife with possibilities, its many empty spaces inviting you to customize your farm as you see fit.\r\n\r\nWhile you could simply focus on creating more area for your sheep to roam, the game also provides plenty of options for customizing your farm with various buildings and features. Not only are these tiles worth victory points at the end of the game, they also make your farm more efficient and more profitable. You might add a feeding trough to your farm, for example, to immediately earn another sheep and the ability to house two sheep per pasture space instead of just one. Or you could construct a lake cabin on your property to get away from it all for a bit. While this tile doesn't give you any special abilities, it increases the value in victory points of the farmyard spaces immediately adjacent to it. Ultimately, you are free to pursue whatever strategy you see fit, building a farm wholly your own.\r\n\r\nOn top of the challenges of building a successful farm, of course, you also have to deal with the tempestuous weather that comes with living on the wave-battered coast of the North Sea. Here, the tides always seem to rise a little higher, threatening to take a dent out of your profits by sweeping away some of your flock. To ensure that this doesn't happen, you always have the opportunity to send your farmers to contribute to the dike instead of working on your farm. When you do, you also commit resources to creating dike elements that are added to the board as a buffer against the rising waters. Add enough of these pieces and you might prevent disaster for everyone. The tide turns repeatedly, bringing with it new flood pieces. If there are enough dike elements in place to hold back the rising waters, players' farms are spared. If the dike breaks, however, you could be forced to take dike breach tokens that have adverse effects at the end of the game.\r\n\r\nWhile lending a hand with the dike at the expense of your own farm is certainly a nice gesture that keeps everyone safe from the floodwaters, it has rewards of its own. For each resource you contribute to the dike, you advance one step up the dike track. Not only does advancing far enough on this track grant victory points, it also amplifies your reward if the dike holds and lessens the blow when it breaks. It is in your best interest, then, to keep pace with other players on the dike in order to protect your investments back home one the farm.\r\n\r\n?description from the publisher\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic4007841.jpg","categoriesprint":"Farming","mechanicsprint":"Action Point Allowance System, Set Collection, Tile Placement, and Worker Placement","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"50","tto":"to","tmax":"100","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/farming.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actionpointallowancesystem.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/tileplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/workerplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Brass Birmingham","id":"224517","year":"2018","name":"Brass: Birmingham","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517","desc":"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.\r\n\r\nAs in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.\r\n\r\nEach round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):\r\n\r\n1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.\r\n2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.\r\n3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.\r\n4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.\r\n5) Loan - Take a ?30 loan and reduce your income.\r\n\r\nBrass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:\r\n\r\n6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)\r\n\r\nThe game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.\r\n\r\nBirmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.\r\n\r\nIron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.\r\n\r\nNew \"Sell\" system\r\n\r\nBrewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.\r\n\r\nBirmingham features three all-new industry types:\r\n\r\nBrewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.\r\n\r\nManufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.\r\n\r\nPottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.\r\n\r\nIncreased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to ?8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.\r\n\r\nBrass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3490053.jpg","categoriesprint":"Economic, Industry / Manufacturing, and Transportation","mechanicsprint":"Hand Management and Route/Network Building","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"60","tto":"to","tmax":"120","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/industrymanufacturing.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Stephenson's Rocket","id":"204","year":"1999","name":"Stephenson's Rocket","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204","desc":"Reiner Knizia expands his fleet of tile laying games with this game about colliding railroads in early 1800's England.

The board is mapped with a series of lines, tracing orbits around the star, and it is along these lines that the tokens are moved. If a matter token moves onto a space occupied by planet token then the matter token is placed on the player's mat (on the respective planet). In the same way, planets can also be moved onto matter tokens, placing the matter tokens on the player's mat.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of a turn a player can play Evolution cards from their hand at the cost of the matter tokens they have collected on their player mat (some cards have other special requirements to play). If a player plays a card, they score the cards points and check to see if their card has changed the state of the planet from hostile to habitable by checking the total habitable and hostile points played to the planet (some end game goals require planets to be hostile or habitable). The player may then draw a card from one of three decks, Low Evolution (cards that score less points but require less matter to play), High Evolution (cards that score more and are harder to play), and Final Evolution (cards that can only be played on a player's final turn).\r\n\r\nThe thematics of the game have been developed with an eye on the science, led by a scientist working on NASA's search for life on Mars. Evolution cards thematically include all kinds of planetary phenomenon, from asteroid impacts, atmospheric effects, to geological events. Final Evolution cards mark the relatively stable state a planet is in at the end of the solar system's development and include classifications for the final planets such as Hot Jupiter or an uninhabitable frozen dwarf planet.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of a beautiful game board with handfuls of matter tokens, approximately 36 Evolution cards and 16 Final Evolution cards (all with unique space art and flavor), player mats, and player and score markers.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3224251.jpg","categoriesprint":"Educational, Science Fiction, and Space Exploration","mechanicsprint":"Grid Movement, Hand Management, and Set Collection","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/educational.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/sciencefiction.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/spaceexploration.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/gridmovement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Unearth","id":"217085","year":"2017","name":"Unearth","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217085","desc":"Long ago, your ancestors built great cities across the world.

The competition for the individual types of goods is considerable - as is the fun in snatching a coveted extension card from under another player's nose!\r\n\r\nAt the start of the game, players have access only to certain resources and goods, due to the different role tiles that each player receives that provide them. At the market, however, a player can acquire additional production sites that give new options. The numerous goods - such as fish, alpaca, cacao, silver, or corn - all have their own characteristics and places where they can be used. Whereas silver makes you rich, fish can be exchanged for other goods, and alpaca give you wool that you can then make into cloth.\r\n\r\nAside from building up an effective production, you must deliver the right goods at the right time, develop the road in good time, and store your goods cleverly enough to fill the most valuable rows with them.

Two to seven aspiring detectives step into the shoes of Doctor Watson, working alongside the detective Sherlock Holmes to try to solve a series of so far unpublished cases directly extracted from Doctor John H. Watson's diaries. Those who accept the challenge relive the adventures of the crime-solving duo, visiting each of the locations where the inquiries were made. Following the trail, each clue brings players closer to solving the case.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to immerse yourself in the Victorian world depicted in each story. Visit the right places, decipher the clues, and above all find the path that leads you to solve the mystery before anybody else. Victory goes to the player who accurately uses the deductive reasoning so famously and ingeniously implemented by the hero of 221B Baker Street.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of a series of separate cases, each of which raises a number of questions that each player tries to solve before anyone else. To do this, once the case and the questions have been read aloud, players proceed to visit the locations where the clues are located. Each location cannot be accessed by more than one player at any one time, so if two or more players want to go to the same place, the player who travels there the fastest (i.e., he who uses the largest number of Carriage Tokens) gets the clue, forcing the others to go to a different location. Once every player has a destination, they proceed to read in secret the clue that was discovered at that location. They can discreetly take any notes they deem appropriate. Once this is done, the cards are returned to their place so that others can read them in later turns.\r\n\r\nThis procedure is repeated during each turn until one player believes he has found the solutions to the case; at that time, he must go to 221B Baker Street to check if his answers are correct. If all the answers are correct, the player wins; if they are wrong, he will have lost and retires from the game, and the game continues.\r\n\r\nEach detective will also have the invaluable assistance of a number of Sherlock Holmes' allies, above all, the good Dr Watson and of course of the detective himself.\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nWatson & Holmes es un juego de deducci?n basado en la admirable obra de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. \r\nCada uno de los dos a siete jugadores adoptar? el papel del Dr. John Watson y acompa?ar? a Sherlock Holmes en la investigaci?n de una serie de casos in?ditos hasta ahora, intentando resolver cada uno de ellos antes de que el gran detective le brinde la soluci?n correcta. Para ello, cada jugador deber? sumergirse en la Inglaterra victoriana e ir recopilando, en distintas localizaciones, las pistas extra?das de los diarios del propio Dr. Watson, con el fin de encajarlas correctamente por medio de la l?gica deductiva.\r\n\r\nY, todo esto, sin demorarse por el camino, pues solo aqu?l que resuelva el misterio antes que sus contrincantes se ganar? la confianza del genio de Baker Street.\r\n\r\nEl juego se compone de una serie de casos independientes, cada uno de los cu?les plantea una serie de interrogantes que cada jugador tratar? de resolver antes que los dem?s.\r\nPara ello, una vez se lean el caso y las preguntas en voz alta, los jugadores proceder?n a visitar las localizaciones donde las pistas se encuentran. Cada localizaci?n no puede ser visitada por m?s de un jugador, de manera que, en caso de que dos o m?s quieran dirigirse a la misma, el jugador que m?s corra (utilizando un mayor n?mero de fichas de Carruaje) obtendr? la pista correspondiente, debiendo los dem?s dirigirse a otras localizaciones.\r\nUna vez cada jugador obtenga un destino, todos proceder?n a leer en secreto la pista aparejada a la localizaci?n correspondiente, pudiendo tomar discretamente las anotaciones que estimen pertinentes. Hecho esto, se devolver?n las cartas de pista a su lugar para que los dem?s puedan leerla en rondas posteriores.\r\nEste procedimiento se repetir? cada ronda, hasta que un jugador crea haber hallado la soluci?n al caso: en ese momento, habr? de dirigirse al 221B para comprobar si sus respuestas son acertadas.\r\nEn caso de ser todas correctas, habr? ganado. En caso de error, habr? perdido y se retirar? de la partida.\r\nCada detective contar?, adem?s, con la inestimable ayuda de una serie de aliados de Sherlock Holmes, as? como con la del propio detective y, sobre todo, la del buen Dr. Watson.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3477808.jpg","categoriesprint":"Bluffing, Deduction, Murder/Mystery, and Novel-based","mechanicsprint":"Auction/Bidding, Memory, Modular Board, Paper-and-Pencil, Player Elimination, and Simultaneous Action Selection","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"7","pl":"players","tmin":"45","tto":"to","tmax":"75","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/bluffing.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/deduction.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/novelbased.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/auctionbidding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/memory.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/modularboard.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/paperandpencil.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/playerelimination.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/simultaneousactionselection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective","id":"2511","year":"1981","name":"Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective: The Thames Murders & Other Cases","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511","desc":"Have you ever had the desire to walk the streets of Victorian London with Sherlock Holmes in search of Professor Moriarty?

The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as ?The Factory?, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.\r\n\r\nScythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europe who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.\r\n\r\nEach player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction?s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).\r\n\r\nScythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player?s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are ?encounter? cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.\r\n\r\nScythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.\r\n\r\nEvery part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3163924.jpg","categoriesprint":"Economic, Fighting, Science Fiction, and Territory Building","mechanicsprint":"Area Control / Area Influence, Grid Movement, and Variable Player Powers","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmin":"90","tto":"to","tmax":"115","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fighting.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/sciencefiction.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/territorybuilding.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/areacontrolareainfluence.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/gridmovement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Viticulture","id":"183394","year":"2015","name":"Viticulture Essential Edition","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183394","desc":"In Viticulture, the players find themselves in the roles of people in rustic, pre-modern Tuscany who have inherited meager vineyards. They have a few plots of land, an old crushpad, a tiny cellar, and three workers. They each have a dream of being the first to call their winery a true success.\r\n\r\nThe players are in the position of determining how they want to allocate their workers throughout the year. Every season is different on a vineyard, so the workers have different tasks they can take care of in the summer and winter. There's competition over those tasks, and often the first worker to get to the job has an advantage over subsequent workers.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the players, people love to visit wineries, and it just so happens that many of those visitors are willing to help out around the vineyard when they visit as long as you assign a worker to take care of them. Their visits (in the form of cards) are brief but can be very helpful.\r\n\r\nUsing those workers and visitors, players can expand their vineyards by building structures, planting vines (vine cards), and filling wine orders (wine order cards). Players work towards the goal of running the most successful winery in Tuscany.\r\n\r\nViticulture - Essential Edition comes with components for Viticulture, but adds some of the expansions from Tuscany, including 36 Mama & Papa cards, Field cards (previously known as \"Properties\"), expanded/revised Visitors, and 24 Automa cards (solo variant), along with a couple of minor rule changes.\r\n\r\nCard Totals\r\n\r\nThe Viticulture Essential Edition contains 154 cards at the 44 x 67 mm size and 88 cards at the 63 x 88 mm size.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic2649952.jpg","categoriesprint":"Economic and Farming","mechanicsprint":"Hand Management and Worker Placement","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"6","pl":"players","tmin":"45","tto":"to","tmax":"90","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/farming.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/workerplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Clans of Caledonia","id":"216132","year":"2017","name":"Clans of Caledonia","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/216132","desc":"Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland.

Moon. \"The tension comes from being forced to balance greed - adding more cards to your hand, and fear - losing a critical route to a competitor.\"\r\n\r\nTicket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.\r\n\r\nSince its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a \"gateway game\" -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.\r\n\r\nPart of the Ticket to Ride series.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic38668.jpg","categoriesprint":"Trains","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, and Set Collection","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmin":"30","tto":"to","tmax":"60","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/trains.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Ticket to Ride United Kingdom","id":"182078","year":"2015","name":"Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 - United Kingdom & Pennsylvania","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182078","desc":"Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 5 - United Kingdom & Pennsylvania contains a double-sided game board with new rules for use with Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe with players now creating train lines in the British Isles and in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania half of this map collection adds a share mechanism to the basic TtR game. Each time that a player completes a route, they claim a share of one of the companies depicted next to that route. At the end of the game, whoever holds more shares of a company than all other players receives points as a reward.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom half of this map collection introduces the concept of technology to TtR. At the start of the game, players can build only one- and two-train routes and only in England. By spending wild cards, players gain the ability to build routes three trains long or longer, in addition to being able to build ferries across water and build train routes in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Players can also buy bonus cards that allow them to score extra points for taking certain actions during play.  Despite the name, the map covers both the UK and the Republic of Ireland, that is, the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nAlthough officially an expansion for Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe, this could be used for Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries.  However use with Nordic Countries would be limited to three players and use of spare trains.  The UK map requires 35 trains, the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains, and Nordic Countries contains 40 of each colour (with 5 spare).\r\n\r\nPart of Ticket to Ride series.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic2640876.jpg","categoriesprint":"Expansion for Base-game and Trains","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, Set Collection, and Stock Holding","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmin":"30","tto":"to","tmax":"75","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/expansionforbasegame.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/trains.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Ticket to Ride India and Switzerland","id":"106645","year":"2011","name":"Ticket to Ride Map Collection: Volume 2 - India & Switzerland","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/106645","desc":"Days of Wonder's Ticket to Ride Map Collection is a series of expansions for Alan R.

India from Ian Vincent - On this game board for 2-4 players, in addition to scoring points for claiming routes and completing tickets, a player can also score points in two other ways. First, the player with the longest continuous path of trains receives a ten point bonus. Second, each player scores bonus points for connecting the cities on one or more tickets with two distinct routes.

Instead of connecting only cities, some destination tickets connect a city to a country or one country to any of those surrounding Switzerland; a player who completes such a ticket scores the highest point value for which she qualifies. Unlike most other TtR games, discarded tickets are removed from the game instead of being returned to the ticket deck.

Each time that you draw cards, you must take a colored tile that's 2-5 train cars long and place that tile on an empty track bed. Once you've done this, any player can claim that route by discarding the appropriately colored cards from hand, as in any other Ticket to Ride game. (Single-length routes are already colored, and the map contains a number of gray-colored ferry routes.)\r\n\r\nMultiple track beds on the game board overlap, and once a tile has placed on the board, any track beds crossed by this tile are off-limits and nothing can be built on them. At the end of the game, players score their tickets, with bonuses being awarded for longest continuous route and most tickets completed.\r\n\r\nIn the Old West half of the expansion, 2-6 players start the game by choosing (in reverse player order) a starting location for one of their three city pieces. The first route that a player claims must have this city as one of the route's two endpoints, and each subsequent route claimed must connect to that player's existing network.\r\n\r\nAfter claiming a route, a player can place one of their remaining cities on either end of that route by discarding a matching pair of train cards. Only one city marker can be in each city. Whenever a player builds a route that connects to a city owned by another player, the owner of the city claims the points for the route, not the player placing the trains. If both endpoints of the route have cities, then the owner of each city scores these points. Whoever completes the most tickets in this expansion scores 15 bonus points.\r\n\r\nAs a variant, you can play Old West with Alvin the Alien. No player can start the game in Roswell, and the first player who builds a route into Roswell scores 10 points, then places the Alvin marker in any city that they control. The next player to connect to this city scores 10 points, then moves Alvin as before. Whoever controls Alvin at the end of the game scores 10 bonus points.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3707326.jpg","categoriesprint":"American West, Expansion for Base-game, and Trains","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Hand Management, Route/Network Building, and Set Collection","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"6","pl":"players","tmin":"60","tto":"to","tmax":"90","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/americanwest.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/expansionforbasegame.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/trains.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Camel Up","id":"153938","year":"2014","name":"Camel Up","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153938","desc":"In Camel Up, up to eight players bet on five racing camels, trying to suss out which will place first and second in a quick race around a pyramid.

But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.\r\n\r\nDownforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.\r\n\r\nThis is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3432548.png","categoriesprint":"Racing","mechanicsprint":"Auction/Bidding, Betting/Wagering, Hand Management, and Variable Player Powers","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"6","pl":"players","tmin":"20","tto":"to","tmax":"40","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/racing.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/auctionbidding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Flamme Rouge","id":"199478","year":"2016","name":"Flamme Rouge","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199478","desc":"The excitement in the air is electric as the leaders round the last corner and head for the finish line.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.\r\n\r\nThe players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.\r\n\r\nYour basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.\r\n\r\nEach player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:\r\n\r\n1) Player order shifts clockwise.\r\n2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.\r\n3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.\r\n4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.\r\n\r\nWhen the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\r\n\r\nIn Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.\r\n    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\r\n\r\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items - but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\r\n\r\nEach player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\r\n\r\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic2869710.jpg","categoriesprint":"American West, Fighting, and Trains","mechanicsprint":"Action / Movement Programming, Hand Management, Memory, Modular Board, Take That, and Variable Player Powers","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"6","pl":"players","tmin":"30","tto":"to","tmax":"40","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/americanwest.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fighting.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/trains.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actionmovementprogramming.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/memory.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/modularboard.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/takethat.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Tortuga 1667","id":"218530","year":"2017","name":"Tortuga 1667","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218530","desc":"The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean.

Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they?ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you?ve seen your friends? loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.\r\n\r\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.\r\n\r\nSince nobody holds a \"hand\" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.\r\n\r\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.\r\n\r\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.

One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. \"Salem\" takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later.\r\n\r\nThe game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique.\r\n\r\nPlayers can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game.\r\n\r\nPlayers, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, \"Witch\" or \"Not a Witch.\"\r\n\r\nDuring gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all \"Witch\" Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.\r\n\r\nPlayers can also use green and blue cards such as \"Alibi\", \"Stocks\", \"Matchmaker\", \"Asylum\", and \"Scapegoat\" to help or hurt their allies or enemies.\r\n\r\nAs players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, \"Night\", forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, \"Conspiracy,\" forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise \"Conspiracy\" may soon have the whole town turned evil.\r\n\r\nBefore long, accusations will be flying, and screams of \"She's a WITCH!\" will wake the neighbours. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft?

If someone on your team doesn?t seem to be pulling their weight, they might be plotting to steal your gold after using you to get to the Finals! There may come a point where you need to gather Showdown Guns instead of Gold, or attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\r\n\r\nDeadwood 1876, volume 3 in the \"Dark Cities\" series from Facade Games, can have 2-9 players.

The young princess sends word of her captivity to fabled outlaw and her true love, Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nHe vows to save her with help from his Merry Men - faithful souls who would follow him to hell and back! But this time, Robin sees doubt in their eyes. Little John, Will Scarlet and the other Merry Men deem the mission so perilous?it could plunge Nottingham into turmoil. Torn between love for the princess and his town, Robin devises a plan to save both! He proposes a challenge, betting his men that none can protect Nottingham as well as he. If one of them bests him at this task, he will bestow his mantle of leadership to the victor!

In the midst of his struggles, he would welcome the news that his brave heroes have completed them.\r\n\r\nIn the Hero phase you will send your Hero to fight the Sheriff?s guards, ambush and rob the royal carriages of their treasures, enter archery tournaments, rescue prisoners from the castle?s darkest dungeons and much much more.\r\n\r\n?description from the publisher\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3697090.jpg","categoriesprint":"Dice, Fighting, and Medieval","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Dice Rolling, Press Your Luck, Set Collection, Variable Player Powers, and Worker Placement","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmin":"60","tto":"to","tmax":"90","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/dice.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fighting.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/medieval.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/dicerolling.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/pressyourluck.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/workerplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"This War of Mine","id":"188920","year":"2017","name":"This War of Mine: The Board Game","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/188920","desc":"This War Of Mine: The Board Game is the tabletop adaptation of the award-winning video game that pictures the drama of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.\r\n\r\nYou will enter this experience as a group of civilians trapped in a besieged and conflict-ridden city, enduring many hardships that often test the essence of humanity.\r\n\r\nDuring day time you will take shelter in a ruined tenement house, which you will care about and manage by: removing rubble, searching through various rooms (often behind barricaded doors), you will build beds, improvised workshops, stoves, tools, water filters, small animal traps, you will cultivate an improvised vegetable garden, fix the tenements? shelled facilities, reinforce the security of your shelter and should winter come, you?ll try to keep it warm.\r\n\r\nUpon nightfall your main duties will consist of guarding your shelter and what little possessions you can accumulate against bandits and raiders. Those in your group fit for such a task will use the cover of the night to carefully explore dozens of the ever-changing locations scattered throughout the dangerous city in search of all the things that a person needs to survive (materials, food, meds, equipment, etc.).

As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.\r\n\r\nSpirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to spread presence into new areas of the island.\r\n\r\nThe Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native islanders present.\r\n\r\nThe islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg) drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.\r\n\r\nThe game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.\r\n\r\nAt game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.\r\n\r\nThe game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3615739.png","categoriesprint":"Age of Reason, Environmental, Fantasy, Fighting, Mythology, Renaissance, and Territory Building","mechanicsprint":"Action / Movement Programming, Area Control / Area Influence, Cooperative Play, Hand Management, Modular Board, Set Collection, Simultaneous Action Selection, and Variable Player Powers","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"90","tto":"to","tmax":"120","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/environmental.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fantasy.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fighting.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/mythology.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/renaissance.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/territorybuilding.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actionmovementprogramming.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/areacontrolareainfluence.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/cooperativeplay.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/modularboard.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/simultaneousactionselection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Feudum","id":"163839","year":"2018","name":"Feudum","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163839","desc":"Blimey!

Players manage a hand of cards to secure transportation, prospect land, and take a shot at winning a title to more land at the poker table.

By observing your opponent?s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic2439223.jpg","categoriesprint":"Fantasy, Fighting, Miniatures, and Mythology","mechanicsprint":"Action Point Allowance System, Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Memory, and Simultaneous Action Selection","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"60","tto":"to","tmax":"90","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/fantasy.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fighting.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/mythology.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actionpointallowancesystem.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/areacontrolareainfluence.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/areamovement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/memory.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/simultaneousactionselection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Mountains of Madness","id":"214293","year":"2017","name":"Mountains of Madness","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/214293","desc":"1931: Your scientific expedition discovers a new and intriguing mountain range in the middle of the Antarctic polar circle.

Players can try to achieve one of three different victory conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Leadership: Be the leader - i.e., have more clan figures than any other player - of territories containing at least six opponents' clans.\r\n     Land: Have your clans present in at least six different territories.\r\n     Religion: Have your clans present in territories that collectively contain at least six sanctuaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the course of the game, players also earn deeds, typically chanted by bards or engraved by master crafters, that reduce by one the magic total of six for any condition. While one victory condition is enough to claim the title of King, a game of experienced players usually has a tight balance of power, emphasizing the leadership of the capital of the island.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each round, players draft a hand of four action cards (with 13 action cards for three players and 17 for four players) during the Assembly. Action cards not played at the end of one season are not held for the next. Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect \"epic tales\" cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.\r\n\r\nCareful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.\r\n\r\nWhile Inis has \"dudes\" that are \"on a map\", it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3112623.jpg","categoriesprint":"Ancient, Card Game, Miniatures, and Mythology","mechanicsprint":"Area Control / Area Influence, Area Movement, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Memory, Modular Board, Tile Placement, and Variable Phase Order","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"60","tto":"to","tmax":"90","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/ancient.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/mythology.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/areacontrolareainfluence.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/areamovement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/memory.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/modularboard.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/tileplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variablephaseorder.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Rising Sun","id":"205896","year":"2018","name":"Rising Sun","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205896","desc":"Rising Sun is a spiritual successor in the same mythic big box series as Blood Rage: same designer, same artist, same studio and same sculptors.\r\n\r\nRising Sun is a game about honor, negotiation, and warfare in a feudal Japan where the ancient gods (kami) have returned to rebuild the empire.\r\n\r\nWhereas the distant ancestor of Blood Rage was Risk, Rising Sun claims Diplomacy as its distant ancestor.

Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an \"Awesome Point\", and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.\r\n\r\nThis, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like \"Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor\".\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are \"Pick 2\" or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.\r\n\r\nFrom the website:\r\n\r\n\"Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.\r\n\r\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.\r\n\r\nAlthough this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.\r\n\r\nThe scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks - Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. - and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains \"master strike\" cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.\r\n\r\nAs players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however - having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes - then the players all lose.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic1430769.jpg","categoriesprint":"Card Game and Comic Book / Strip","mechanicsprint":"Cooperative Play and Deck / Pool Building","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"5","pl":"players","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cooperativeplay.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/deckpoolbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Concordia","id":"124361","year":"2013","name":"Concordia","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124361","desc":"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea.

The game features elements of dice drafting and strategic engine building. The game is low on luck and has no direct destructive player conflict; all components are language independent.\r\n\r\nIn the game, you expand your colony by placing polyominoes with buildings on your colony board. Dice (representing migrant workers) are used to activate buildings; each die activates a complete row or column of buildings in your colony. The buildings are activated in order (left to right / top to bottom), then the die is placed on the last activated building to block this space. It is therefore crucial where you put new buildings in your colony, and in which order you use the dice.\r\n\r\nAs the game progresses, you produce resources, form shipping routes, send out conquistadors, and improve your religious power to recruit monks. When you recruit a monk, you must decide if it becomes a scholar (providing a permanent special ability), a missionary (for an immediate bonus) or a bishop (for possible end game points). The player who has accumulated the most happiness after three rounds wins. The available specialists, end game bonuses and buildings vary from game to game, which makes for near endless replayability.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3882016.jpg","categoriesprint":"Civilization and Farming","mechanicsprint":"Dice Rolling, Set Collection, Tile Placement, and Variable Player Powers","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"45","tto":"to","tmax":"90","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/civilization.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/farming.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/dicerolling.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/tileplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"The Quest For El Dorado","id":"217372","year":"2017","name":"The Quest for El Dorado","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/217372","desc":"In The Quest for El Dorado, players take the roles of expedition leaders who have embarked on a search for the legendary land of gold in the dense jungles of South America.

The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\r\n\r\nThe game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections.\r\n\r\nTaking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five?but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!\r\n\r\nThe 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters?the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist?not available in earlier editions of the game.\r\n\r\nPandemic is the first game in the Pandemic series.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic1534148.jpg","categoriesprint":"Medical","mechanicsprint":"Action Point Allowance System, Cooperative Play, Hand Management, Point to Point Movement, Set Collection, Trading, and Variable Player Powers","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actionpointallowancesystem.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/cooperativeplay.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/pointtopointmovement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/trading.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Plague Inc","id":"195162","year":"2017","name":"Plague Inc.: The Board Game","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/195162","desc":"Plague Inc: The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction for 1-5* people - based on the smash-hit digital game with over 85 million players.

Players choose which countries are placed on the board but you must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before you can infect it.

As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. Players will need to assemble a crew, collect provisions and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. There is glory to be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie. So gather your warriors, it?s raiding season!\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAim of the Game\r\n\r\nThe aim of Raiders of the North Sea is to impress the Chieftain by having the most Victory Points (VP) at the game?s end. Victory Points are gained primarily by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and making Offerings to the Chieftain. How players use their Plunder is also vital to their success. The game ends when either only 1 Fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie are removed, or all Offerings have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGameplay Overview\r\n\r\nProceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes his turn in full. On his turn, a player may choose to Work or Raid. Players continue to take turns until 1 of the 3 end-game conditions has been met. Regardless of choices, each turn follows the same pattern:\r\n\r\n1. Place Worker and resolve its action\r\n2. Pick up a different Worker and resolve its action\r\n\r\nWorking\r\nHaving a good Crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding. So before making any raids, players will need to do some work to prepare their Crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the Village, at the bottom of the board. There are 8 different buildings, with various actions. Players must first place their one and only Worker in an available building (where there is no Worker present), before picking up a different Worker from a different building (where there is a Worker present).\r\n\r\nRaiding\r\nOnce players have hired enough Crew and collected Provisions, they may choose to raid on their turn. To raid a Settlement (Harbour, Outpost, Monastery or Fortress), players need to meet 3 requirements. They must have:\r\n\r\n1. A large enough Crew.\r\n2. Enough Provisions (and Gold for Monasteries/Fortresses).\r\n3. The required Worker colour.\r\n\r\nRaiding offers various ways of scoring (Military Strength, Plunder, Valkyrie, etc.).

Select from a variety of heroes that play and feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of five dice. Accumulate combat points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at a turn of a 1v1 game.\r\n\r\nThe game begins with 2 players selecting their heroes. Player One chooses Moon Elf and player two picks Barbarian. Each player begins the game with 50 HP (Health Points).\r\n\r\nPlayer One (the Moon Elf) won the roll to go first. The Moon Elf draws their 4 starting game cards and begins the game with 1 CP (Combat Point). \r\n\r\n    Note- The player that wins the starting roll does not draw a card (above their starting hand of 4) or gain CP above their 1 starting CP. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moon Elf then checks for status effects (like poison, or Burn) to resolve.\r\n\r\nThe next phase is called Main Phase (1). This is where the Moon Elf player can upgrade their hero board with cards from their hands if they have enough CP to pay for the upgrades. They can also play any Main Phase Action cards (blue cards).\r\n\r\nThen they enter the Offensive Roll Phase. The Moon Elf can take up to 3 roll attempts (with their 5 dice) to accomplish an action or attack from their hero board. After deciding on an action within the 3 roll attempts an action is declared.\r\n\r\nThen the Defensive Roll Phase begins where the opponent (Barbarian) can use their defensive roll (as it appears on their hero board). The amount of damage or incoming status affects are resolved and that concludes the Defensive Roll Phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n     During Offensive and Defensive Roll Phase any player can play Roll Phase Action cards from their hand as long as they have the CP to pay for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moon Elf player enters their second Main Phase where they can do any final hero board upgrades or play blue Main Phase Action cards.\r\n\r\nThe Moon Elf then must discard any extra cards over 6 from their hand.\r\n\r\nThe Barbarian player begins his turn by drawing one additional card (over his starting hand of 4) and gaining one CP (Combat Point) for a total of 2.\r\n\r\nThe Barbarian then follows the same phases the Moon Elf.\r\n\r\nThe game alternates hero turns until one player is at 0 Health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiceThrone is for 2-6 players, ages 8+, and runs 20-30 minutes for a battle.

At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\r\n\r\nDuring a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\r\n\r\nAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\r\n\r\nEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects.

The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm? Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.\r\n\r\nEach round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!\r\n\r\nAt launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets - Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards - and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.\r\n\r\n?description from the publisher\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3363466.jpg","categoriesprint":"Card Game, Collectible Components, Dice, Fighting, Game System, Movies / TV / Radio theme, and Science Fiction","mechanicsprint":"Dice Rolling, Hand Management, and Variable Player Powers","plmax":"2","pl":"players","tmax":"30","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/dice.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fighting.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/moviestvradiotheme.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/sciencefiction.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/dicerolling.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/variableplayerpowers.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Welcome To","id":"233867","year":"2018","name":"Welcome To...","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/233867","desc":"As an architect in Welcome To..., you want to build the best new town in the United States of the 1950s by adding resources to a pool, hiring employees, and more.\r\n\r\nWelcome To... plays like a roll-and-write dice game in which you mark results on a score-sheet...but without dice.

Once you have a highway, you can possibly place one of your ten cars on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nGoal of the Game\r\n\r\nYou must construct a highway and place all your cars on the highway by crossing your opponent?s roads. The first player to place all 10 cars is the winner.\r\n\r\nPlaying the Game\r\n\r\nYou have three things to do during your turn.\r\n\r\n2? Constructing a pillar\r\nPick a location to construct a pillar.\r\nYou may freely choose the construction point as long as your pillar is reachable from the base point. A base point is the location of a pillar or junction constructed in previous turn. The height of the pillar must be 1 above or 1 below the base point. You may not construct a pillar of the same height, 2 stories above or below the height of a base point (following is an exception - 6. Constructing a Junction).\r\n\r\n2? Constructing a road\r\nA new road must rest between the base point and the pillar constructed in phase 2?.\r\nYou may adjust the position of the pillar when placing a road.\r\n\r\n2? Placing cars on highway \r\nWhen conditions are met, you may place a car on the road (Refer to - 5. Conditions for Car Placement).\r\nYour turn ends with your opponent?s judge. \r\nIf there is a problem, it must be sorted out on the spot.\r\n\r\nGame goes on repeating 2? to 2? alternately.\r\nYou may no longer adjust the position of your pillar, road or car once your opponent constructs a new pillar.\r\n\r\nConditions for Car Placement\r\n\r\nThe chance to place a car on the highway occurs only to the newest road you construct. To place a car,  your newest road must cross your opponent?s road. There are two ways to cross your opponent?s road: crossing over or crossing under it.\r\n\r\nWhen crossing over : \r\nthere exist no other roads over opponent?s road\r\n\r\nWhen crossing under : \r\nthere exist no other roads under opponent?s road\r\n\r\nWhen either of the conditions is met, you may place a car on the highway. If not, you may not place a car but may still connect the road to the next pillar.\r\n\r\nIf the road crosses multiple roads, you may place multiple cars depending on the number of roads crossed.\r\n\r\ncrossing over two roads at the same time\r\ncrossing over and crossing under two roads at the same time\r\n\r\n??Caution?\r\n?? You may not place a car when crossing over/under your own road.\r\n?? You may not place a car on already constructed roads later on in the game.\r\nKeep the traffic rules and enjoy driving!\r\n\r\nConstructing a Junction\r\nThe yellow pillar is called the junction. Using a junction, you may do the following.\r\n\r\n2? Increase or decrease the height of the pillar by any number\r\nYou may increase or decrease the height of your pillar regardless of the height of the pillar at the base point. However, you need to have at least one gray pillar under the junction. You may only construct a pillar of one more or less stories as usual in the following turn.\r\n\r\nBe careful, if the road angle is too steep you?ll have trouble placing cars!\r\n\r\n2? Branching out to two-ways\r\nYou may branch out your highway from a junction anytime during the game.\r\n\r\nConstructing Exit to Highway\r\n\r\nIf you can ground a road safely to the table, you have created an exit to your highway. You may place an additional car as a bonus point on the exit road. If the road crosses your opponent?s road(s) while grounding, you may place multiple cars on the road. You can not start a new road from the exit.\r\n\r\nPenalty\r\n\r\nIf you drop your opponent?s car or road during construction, you must hand over your pillars to your opponent as penalty. You must offer a number of pieces equivalent to the materials you dropped. Game proceeds only after the parts are fixed by the player responsible. There is no penalty for dropping your own pieces.\r\n\r\nEnd of the Game\r\n\r\n1. When all 10 cars are placed on the highway\r\nThe first player to finish all 10 cars is the winner.\r\n\r\n2. When construction materials run out\r\nIf you are out of construction materials, you must wait for your opponent to finish the next turn. If the opponent finishes the turn with no penalty, the player with no more construction materials is the loser.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3290526.png","categoriesprint":"Action / Dexterity","mechanicsprint":"Line Drawing and Route/Network Building","plmax":"2","pl":"players","tmin":"30","tto":"to","tmax":"50","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actiondexterity.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/linedrawing.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"The Flow of History","id":"204574","year":"2016","name":"The Flow of History","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204574","desc":"Description from the publisher:\r\n\r\nHistory is a harsh river that flows steadily through the ages.

It is said that it \"survived its own death\", and there is truth in this. Poland's capital was largely destroyed during the Second World War, and its reconstruction was an exceptional urban development process. Warsaw is a combination of elegant buildings from Saxon times, architecture from between the World Wars, socialist blocks, and modern buildings. Walking through the streets of Warsaw's Wola district, one can see this diversity at a glance. Modern glass office buildings stand next to pre-war automotive garages, and concrete block buildings touch elegant older houses, which show the signs of time's decay. Some call it a spatial mess, while others see in it the residents' determination. Both views are right because that's how Warsaw is. Maybe not the most beautiful, but strong and determined. Nothing reflects the city's character more than its diverse buildings.\r\n\r\nIn Capital, players jointly build Warsaw over six epochs, from when Warsaw first became the capital at the end of the 16th century through modern times. Each player creates their own district of the city. At the end of each of the six epochs, districts give income and victory points to their owners. After six rounds, whoever has the most points wins.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, each epoch consists of a construction phase and an income phase, with wars at the end of the third and fourth epochs. During the construction phase of an epoch, players shuffle the city tiles with the current epoch's number, then deal several tiles to each player. Each player chooses one of the tiles, then places it face down onto the table. All players simultaneously reveal their selected tiles, and each player chooses one of two possible actions:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Discard their tile to the box and take three coins from the bank.\r\n     Pay the tile's cost in coins and build the tile in their district.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of placing a tile on an empty space, a player may choose to build on top of an existing tile. Simply place the new tile directly onto an existing tile, covering it completely. As a result, the new tile's price is reduced by the price of the older tile that it covers. A player's district can never be larger than a 3?4 or 4?3 rectangle of tiles. Each city tile is divided into four quarters, and each quarter has its own type of building, so a tile can have 1-4 different kinds of buildings. Public buildings and milestones are always separate individual areas, even if they are adjacent to each other. They also occupy an entire tile.\r\n\r\nDuring the income phase, milestones are placed, and players receive coins and victory points.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic4155728.jpg","categoriesprint":"City Building and Economic","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Simultaneous Action Selection, and Tile Placement","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"45","tto":"to","tmax":"60","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/citybuilding.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/economic.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/simultaneousactionselection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/tileplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Flipships","id":"223215","year":"2017","name":"Flipships","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/223215","desc":"\"It was an ambush.

Players get points for completing their own theories, contributing to the theories of other players, and helping to finish major theories from Einstein's life.\r\n\r\nAs Albert Einstein transcended science and became a recognizable figure around the world, so the game Einstein focuses on simple rules and quick playability, an accessible strategy game for gamers and non-gamers alike.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3213340.png","categoriesprint":"Puzzle and Territory Building","mechanicsprint":"Modular Board, Pattern Building, Route/Network Building, Set Collection, and Tile Placement","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"15","tto":"to","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/puzzle.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/territorybuilding.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/modularboard.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/patternbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/tileplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Decrypto","id":"225694","year":"2018","name":"Decrypto","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225694","desc":"Players compete in two teams in Decrypto, with each trying to correctly interpret the coded messages presented to them by their teammates while cracking the codes they intercept from the opposing team.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, each team has their own screen, and in this screen they tuck four cards in pockets numbered 1-4, letting everyone on the same team see the words on these cards while hiding the words from the opposing team. In the first round, each team does the following: One team member takes a code card that shows three of the digits 1-4 in some order, e.g., 4-2-1. They then give a coded message that their teammates must use to guess this code. For example, if the team's four words are \"pig\", \"candy\", \"tent\", and \"son\", then I might say \"Sam-striped-pink\" and hope that my teammates can correctly map those words to 4-2-1. If they guess correctly, great; if not, we receive a black mark of failure.\r\n\r\nStarting in the second round, a member of each team must again give a clue about their words to match a numbered code. If I get 2-4-3, I might now say, \"sucker-prince-stake\". The other team then attempts to guess our numbered code. If they're correct, they receive a white mark of success; if not, then my team must guess the number correctly or take a black mark of failure. (Guessing correctly does nothing except avoid failure and give the opposing team information about what our hidden words might be.)\r\n\r\nThe rounds continue until a team collects either its second white mark (winning the game) or its second black mark (losing the game). Games typically last between 4-7 rounds. If neither team has won after eight rounds, then each team must attempt to guess the other team's words; whichever team guesses more words correctly wins.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3759421.jpg","categoriesprint":"Deduction and Word Game","mechanicsprint":"Partnerships","plmin":"3","plto":"to","plmax":"8","pl":"players","tmin":"15","tto":"to","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/deduction.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/wordgame.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/partnerships.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Burgle Bros","id":"172081","year":"2015","name":"Burgle Bros.","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172081","desc":"Burgle Bros. is a cooperative game for 1-?4 players.

Each player takes five buttons - the currency/points in the game - and someone is chosen as the start player.\r\n\r\nOn a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn \"button income\": sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the first player to completely fill in a 7x7 square on his game board earns a bonus tile worth 7 extra points at the end of the game. (Of course, this doesn't happen in every game.)\r\n\r\nWhen a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he takes one final button income from the bank. Once both players are in the center, the game ends and scoring takes place. Each player scores one point per button in his possession, then loses two points for each empty square on his game board. Scores can be negative.

Players start with a hand of seven cards. On each turn, a player draws two cards (from the deck or one or more of the discard piles), lays a card on the table as part of her arboretum, then discards a card to her personal discard pile.\r\n\r\nWhen the deck is exhausted, players compare the cards that remain in their hands to determine who can score each color.

For each card in a path that scores, the player earns one point; if the path consists solely of trees of the color being scored, the player scores two points per card.

In ?Bridges to Nowhere?, you are attempting to outwit your opponent and construct the most magnificent bridge. Will you plan for a sturdy long bridge, or maybe take a risk with a shorter multilevel bridge where your points can soar as you reach for great heights? Whatever you do, don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent or you may just hand them the victory.\r\n\r\n?Bridges to Nowhere? is a 10-minute, 2-player micro game of strategic card drafting and bridge building. In 4 quick rounds, Players take turns drafting \"bridge cards\" which they will use to attach to larger \"pillar cards\" creating a unique Bridge tableau in front of them. At the end of 4 rounds, the Player whose bridge scores them the most points wins!\r\n\r\nNo one ever said building a bridge was easy though! The challenge and fun of Bridges to Nowhere is found in trying to plan and build within the very particular guidelines of the game. There are three different types of bridge cards (Truss/Cable/Suspension) and they may never be mixed together in the same bridge. Not only that, each bridge card has a numeric point value listed at the bottom along with two symbols, one on each side. Two cards with the same bridge number can never be placed side by side, AND a single line of adjacent bridge cards can only ascend and/or descend numerically once in a single bridge segment.\r\n\r\nThe Pillar cards are what you'll need to frame your bridge segments and possibly lay a foundation for a double or even TRIPLE decker bridge(if you've got the nerve). Be careful though, your Pillar cards are a strategic resource. If you don't play them just right you may end up with only a partially finished bridge, and that will cost you!\r\n\r\nOh, but don't forget those symbols! If you can match two of the same symbols side by side in a bridge segment you'll reap big point bonuses. Another way to gain bonuses in the game is by completing Contract cards. These give both players a very specific set of bridge construction goals to try and reach in order to gain a medium or large point boost to their total score.\r\n\r\nBridges to Nowhere is a fun and engaging game that plays as beautifully as it looks. With elegant gameplay that challenges players to keep their wits about them at every draw of a card, Bridges to Nowhere brings fun to the table again and again.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3457641.jpg","categoriesprint":"Card Game","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting, Pattern Building, Set Collection, and Tile Placement","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"10","tto":"to","tmax":"30","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/patternbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/tileplacement.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Pit Crew","id":"218161","year":"2017","name":"Pit Crew","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218161","desc":"While the driver gets all the attention, the pit crew are the unsung heroes of racing?\r\n\r\nPit Crew is a lightning-fast game where up to three teams of players must work together to get their race car back onto the track as quickly as possible.

Each player will control a six-member gang competing to survive with only their instincts, a quick draw, and dynamite.\r\n\r\nThe game is played in turns. Each player has a home base card in front of him. Each turn, the player whose turn it is flips open a card from the common deck. The other players now have a chance to react.\r\n\r\n\r\n    If a Talkin? Iron card is revealed, players can choose to make an offensive or a defensive move. If players want to take a shot, they can slap one hand on the Talkin? Iron card and simultaneously make a pistol-finger with their other hand, pointing at any other player. Only one player gets to actually take a shot - the one who slaps the Talkin? Iron card first. Instead of trying to slap the gun, players can slap into a home base by slapping any of the home bases on the table. Only one player?s hand can be in a home base at a time. Players who slap into a home base can?t be hit by a player who takes a shot, and they can safely keep their hand on that home base until they?re forced to move.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    If a Big Gun card is revealed, players can slap it to take a shot or slap into a home base. Just like a Talkin? Iron, only one player can use it to take a shot - the first one to slap the card and simultaneously point a pistol-finger at another player. Unlike a Talkin? Iron, a Big Gun is extraordinarily destructive, and damages players even if they?re in a home base.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    If a Gold card is revealed, players can take the card into their possession by slapping it. If you point at another player while slapping the gold, the player you point at takes the gold instead. Gold is required to activate most gang?s special powers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    When a Move! card is revealed, everyone needs to slap into a home base. If a player is already in a home base, they need to slap into a new home base. The last player to slap into a new home base loses one member of their gang. If anyone mistakenly slaps the Move! card, they lose one gang member, everyone else is safe regardless of where they slapped, and the turn ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers take turns until only one gang is left standing.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic2237139.jpg","categoriesprint":"Action / Dexterity, American West, and Card Game","mechanicsprint":"Action / Movement Programming","plmin":"3","plto":"to","plmax":"7","pl":"players","tmax":"20","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actiondexterity.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/americanwest.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/actionmovementprogramming.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"A Game of Thrones Hand of the King","id":"205610","year":"2016","name":"A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205610","desc":"Description from the publisher:\r\n\r\nThe king has called for a lavish feast and tourney, the likes of which have not been seen in the Seven Kingdoms since the days of Aegon the Conquerer.

Only one family will survive...\r\n\r\nIn Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.\r\n\r\nEach player starts the game with two coins and two influence - i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury.

In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.\r\n\r\nIf you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.\r\n\r\nThe last player to still have influence - that is, a face-down character - wins the game!\r\n\r\nA new & optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards & Cards.

If you make it far enough, you'll have to fight the dungeon boss. Survive, and you'll be a legend!\r\n\r\nOne Deck Dungeon is designed for 1-2 players. With multiple sets, you can add more players.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3019101.jpg","categoriesprint":"Card Game, Dice, Fantasy, Medieval, and Video Game Theme","mechanicsprint":"Cooperative Play, Deck / Pool Building, and Dice Rolling","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"2","pl":"players","tmin":"30","tto":"to","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/dice.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/fantasy.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/medieval.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/videogametheme.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cooperativeplay.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/deckpoolbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/dicerolling.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"The Mind","id":"244992","year":"2018","name":"The Mind","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992","desc":"The Mind is more than just a game.

In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\r\n\r\nYou start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!\r\n\r\nFor an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.\r\n\r\nOnce only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you.

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!\r\n\r\n6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have.

After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.\r\n\r\nThe Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.\r\n\r\nPlayers have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.\r\n\r\nThe Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.\r\n\r\nThe miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.\r\n\r\nAction Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself.

The only limit to the number of players is the number of boards you have!\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic4097632.png","categoriesprint":"Trains","mechanicsprint":"Paper-and-Pencil and Route/Network Building","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"6","pl":"players","tmin":"20","tto":"to","tmax":"30","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/trains.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/paperandpencil.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/routenetworkbuilding.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Ravine","id":"237728","year":"2017","name":"Ravine","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237728","desc":"Ravine is a strategic and cooperative survival card game.

New powers of interstellar travel make it possible for earthlings to find a new home. Competing teams of human explorers use space stations spread throughout the universe as bases for discovering new worlds and befriending aliens to help them in their quest. Explorer teams are not only racing each other, but an alien race also hoping to discover the planets. Will your team be able to reach a planets before the others to establish colonies?\r\n\r\nCosmic Run: Regeneration is a revised version of Cosmic Run. Like the original, Cosmic Run: Regeneration is a quick, push-your-luck, space race for 1-4 players. On a turn, a player rolls dice and must commit at least 1 of them to one of the various exploration tracks or to an alien card. Some of the tracks require multiple identical dice, with the most valuable tracks costing many identical dice. However, once a player commits a die, it cannot be moved. So players have to decide between a conservative approach (making sure and steady progress along less valuable tracks) or an aggressive approach (pushing one's luck to try to move up the highly valued tracks).\r\n\r\nPlayers may opt to use their dice to befriend aliens, rather than explore, because the aliens provide special powers that can eventually help them move along their exploration tracks even faster.  The game may be played competitively or cooperatively.\r\n\r\nCosmic Run: Regeneration is different from the original Cosmic Run in many ways. Regarding the rules, these are the main changes:\r\n- A 6th planet track with its own rules for placement\r\n- A 6th type of alien card\r\n- The mechanism for the alien race landing on planets (which used to be meteors hitting planets) is now card-based, rather than dice\r\n- Alien cards must be turned in during the game to score points\r\n- Alien cards are one use and easier to acquire\r\n\r\nThe game's components are also different, insofar as this game has a full board and some updated graphic design.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic4119943.jpg","categoriesprint":"Dice, Racing, and Space Exploration","mechanicsprint":"Dice Rolling and Press Your Luck","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"30","tto":"to","tmax":"45","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/dice.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/racing.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/spaceexploration.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/dicerolling.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/pressyourluck.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Little Flower Shop","id":"218025","year":"2018","name":"The Little Flower Shop","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218025","desc":"Description from the publisher:\r\n\r\nYou're working for the little flower shop in the heart of the village. To attract customers, you'll need to arrange the most beautiful display of flowers in the shop's window.\r\n\r\nThe Little Flower Shop is a light, yet strategic, set collection game featuring stunning artwork by botanical artist Sarah Wry. Mechanically, the game employs a familiar card drafting system of picking a card and passing the rest.  The cards are then used according to their type.  Vase cards are placed in a player's shop window.  Flower cards are tucked under the vases, provided they meet the vase's requirements. Basket cards may be hung at the top of a player's window, but only if they can buy the baskets first.  Salary cards provide free income.  Sale cards allow players to sell flowers to put additional funds in their register.  At the game's end, players score points for the best display of flowers in their windows.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic3762725.jpg","categoriesprint":"Other","mechanicsprint":"Card Drafting and Set Collection","plmin":"1","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmin":"20","tto":"to","tmax":"30","categoriesidlist":"","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Biblios","id":"34219","year":"2007","name":"Biblios","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/34219","desc":"THE GAME CONCEPT\r\nYou are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF GAME PLAY\r\nThe object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.\r\n\r\nGAME CHARACTERISTICS\r\nThe game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.\r\n\r\n","imagefile":"pic759154.jpg","categoriesprint":"Card Game, Medieval, and Religious","mechanicsprint":"Auction/Bidding, Card Drafting, Hand Management, Press Your Luck, and Set Collection","plmin":"2","plto":"to","plmax":"4","pl":"players","tmax":"30","categoriesidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/cardgame.png\" class=\"category\"><img src=\"./img/icons/medieval.png\" class=\"category\">","mechanicsidlist":"<img src=\"./img/icons/auctionbidding.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/carddrafting.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/handmanagement.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/pressyourluck.png\" class=\"mechanic\"><img src=\"./img/icons/setcollection.png\" class=\"mechanic\">"},{"game":"Duelosaur Island","id":"247236","year":"2018","name":"Duelosaur Island","url":"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/247236","desc":"Duelosaur Island is built around a clever hand-management mechanism. Each card in the game serves three potential purposes.

Do you create the dinosaur on the top of the card to attract guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can add to a player's hand-limit, income, and end-game victory points? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur?\r\n\r\nDuelosaur Island comes with five new full-color \"DNA dice\".
